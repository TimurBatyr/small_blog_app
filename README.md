## Small Blog App

This is a small blog applicationlike tweeter. Here I used Rails Scaffolding tool
in order to build this application.

This messenger covers routes:
  - /users                - shows all users
  - /users/1              - shows user with id 1 and deletes
  - /users/new            - creates a new user
  - /users/1/edit         - edits the information about user with id 1
 

  - /microposts           - shows all posts
  - /microposts/1         - shows post with id 1 and deletes
  - /microposts/new       - creates a new post
  - /microposts/1/edit    - edits the written post with id 1
